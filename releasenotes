- First version based on pixman 0.34.0.


pixman-1.library 53.2 (6.8.2017)

- Made libClose() free the TLS data of the current process. This should stop
  dos.library from complaining about tc_Entry being non-empty on return when
  the program has been run from the commandline or using IDOS->RunCommand().
